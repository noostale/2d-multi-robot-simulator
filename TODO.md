# TODO list

## To do

## In progress

- [ ] Do [this](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage) tutorial

## Completed

- [x] Install AutoHotKey to use altcodes in my laptop
- [x] Install and configure ros_noetic and catkin using [this](https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) tutorial

## Important notes

Usually you must source this script in every bash terminal you use ROS in:
`source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash`
But you can add it to your bashrc file to avoid doing it every time you open a new terminal:
`echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc`
